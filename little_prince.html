<body>As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set oit walking once more.</body>

<underline>I felt deeply moved, ans stirred. It seemed ot me that i was carrying a ver fragile treasure.</underline>
<highlight>It seemed to me, even, that there eas nothing more frogile on all Earth.</highlight>
<body>In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself:</body>
<p>"What I see here is nothing but shell. What is most important is invisible..."</p>
<body>As his lips opened slightly with the suspcion of half-smile, I said to myself, again:</body>
<p>"What moves me so deeply, about this lttke prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower--the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep..."</p>
<body>And I felt him to be more fragile still.</body>
<underline>I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that mightt be extinguished by a little puff of wind...</undelrine>
